# Getting Started with C++

**Make sure to not skip the theory before doing practise.**

C++ is a mid-level programming language commonly used in game development, software engineering, and even some mobile applications.
If this is your first time working with a mid-level programming language, C++ is a good starting point.

## Setting Up Your First C++ Project

**1. Create a Project Folder:** Start by creating a folder or repository named FirstCppApp (or any name you prefer).

**2. Create Your First File:** Inside this folder, create a new file. eg.: FirstOutputWithCPP.cpp.

**Note:** Always use the .cpp extension for C++ files as it’s essential for proper compilation and recognition.

### Basic C++ File Structure

Most C++ programs begin with the following structure:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Code execution starts here
    return 0; // Indicates successful program execution
}
```

- **#include <iostream>:** Includes the library for input and output operations.

- **int main():** The entry point of the program.

- **return 0;:** Ends the program and signals successful execution, if it's return 1 it's a problem.


## C++ vs Other Languages

If you have experience with languages like Python or Lua, you’ll notice that C++ has a more rigid syntax. However, if you’ve worked with Java or JavaScript, you might find some similarities in structure and syntax.

C++ requires more attention to detail, such as:

- Proper use of semicolons (;)
- Declaring variable types explicitly

It’s different from dynamic languages and requires dedication to master. But with persistence, it will be an easy pizi programming language.

## Adding Comments in C++

Comments are essential for explaining code and making it easier to understand. Here’s how to add comments in C++:

### Single-Line Comments

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-Line Comments

```cpp
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
You can use it if you wanna explain something
*/
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To code efficiently in C++, it’s important to have the right tools:

**1. Visual Studio Code (VSC):**

- Install the C/C++ extension to enable syntax highlighting, debugging, and IntelliSense.

**2. Code Runner (Extension):**

This extension supports running multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and more. It simplifies the process of compiling and running your code directly from VSC.

## Running & Debugging

Alright, another thing you'll run through and not a lot of people talk about it's when you try to run the code, it doesn't work, it tells you to either open .vscode/launch.json or/and .vscode/tasks.json

When I started learning, I always had this problem, I almost gave up because of this, it's an easy fix.

tasks.json
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "cppbuild",
      "label": "C/C++: clang++ build active file",
      "command": "/usr/bin/clang++",
      "args": [
        "-fcolor-diagnostics",
        "-fansi-escape-codes",
        "-g",
        "${file}",
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
      ],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
      },
      "problemMatcher": ["$gcc"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
    }
  ],
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

^ Usually, you don't have issues with tasks.json, but that doesn't mean you'll never will, but if you doing a console app, advanced or simple, usually you won't modify this a lot or at all.

launch.json
```json
{
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "C/C++: clang++ build and debug active file",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
        "args": [],
        "stopAtEntry": false,
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
        "environment": [],
        "externalConsole": false,
        "MIMode": "lldb",
        "preLaunchTask": "C/C++: clang++ build active file"
      }
    ],
    "version": "2.0.0"
  }
```

^ Alright, this one is usually the main issue to beginners with C++ on VSC. The launch.json that I just provided is a very simple one that is used by MacOs Operating Systems to create very basic console apps.

launch.json is usually a file that you either will change a lot or almost nothing.

If you ever used Node.js, think launch.json as the package.json. But you don't put on launch.json libraries.

## Digging Deeper

**std::cout** is part of the standard input-output library in C++ and is used to print output to the console eg.:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```

**- std refers to the standard namespace.**

**- cout stands for "character output."**

**- << is the insertion operator used to send data to the console.**

**\n** is a newline character used to move the cursor to the next line

**std::endl** also moves the cursor to the next line, similar to **\n**, but it additionally flushes the output buffer.

### std::endl vs \n

- Use std::endl when you want the output to be immediately displayed.
- For general use, \n is often more efficient as it doesn’t flush the buffer. 

# Wrapping Up

Now you know how to:
- Set up your first C++ project
- Create and structure a C++ file
- Add comments to your code
- Configure your development environment
- Make the most basic console app based on "prints"
- Understand and use std::cout, \n, and std::endl
- If a roadblock called launch.json or tasks.json appear to annoy you, you'll know how to fix!

If you want to stop reading the basics and go to official documentation which is also an option, you can do it here:
